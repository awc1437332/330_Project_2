                <p>
                    In this project we created a game using Matter.js. The game has applicable physics and is designed
                    to be a platformer revolved around speedrunning. The faster you complete the game the better your
                    score will be. Matter.js is a physics engine that can create physics bodies that we can apply force
                    to. For the styling we use bulma, and we are also using web components. We use three of the
                    components to help our site. We used a header, a footer, and an instructions component.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This game has standard wasd controls, while s does nothing w jumps and a and d move left and right
                    respectfully. We load in a json file with hand-made levels. We have also loaded in sounds to augment
                    the game's experience. We use js modules to help our game run properly. We really went all out to
                    make our own material for this game. We had a lot of fun playing through it and we hope you do too!

                <p>
                    We have a very unique theme about jello, and the art is all pixels and the font we use is also pixels. The game plays as intended and we believe it is engaging. The game is playable and navigable. The site has documentation about what we did. The content of the site fits the standards we were given. We use three web components which meets the requirements for this project. We load in data from a json file to create and run our in game levels. We have validated and checked our html and css files. Our code fits our standards, however it should be noted that matter.js would not behave properly with modules. Because of this we believe that we deserve a 95% on this project. We really gave it our all and did our best to meet the standards and complete this project.

                <p>
                    All that we really wanted to add was firebase functionality to get players across a database to
                    compete against each other for time scores. Other than that we did all that we set out to do in this
                    game and more. We created our own levels, and added music to make this game pop.
